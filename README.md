## ℹ️ Overview

This form builder will allow users to build interactive forms which are completely customisable at a professional standard. This will give users to put their own label on their forms and handle data their own way. Out of the box, each form is stored in a table which is stored in a warehouse for each tenant using an S3 bucket. However, with APIs for everything, developers can store their data in their own data solution and opt out of locally stored data.
